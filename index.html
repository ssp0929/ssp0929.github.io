			<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
			<br>
			<p>I'm a software developer. I enjoy building scalable, efficient systems to solve complex problems.</p>
			<p>I'm a web developer. I enjoy deploying web apps using the latest languages and frameworks.</p>
			<p>I'm a learner. I enjoy learning about new technologies, languages, and follow tech news daily.</p>
			<p>I'm a person. I enjoy sports, cooking, graphic design, and video games.</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<h1>What Have I Worked On?</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				I've worked on a full stack web application built on top of the LAMP stack.
				Then, I refactored it using a React front-end, and a Node.js/Express.js/PostgreSQL backend and am currently hosting it on Heroku.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				After learning a little Python and getting familiar with working with various APIs,
				I created an interactive bot for a Discord server that responds to user commands in real-time,
				a scraper that scrapes data from Reddit, and a scraper that scrapes RSS feeds.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Then I started getting intrigued by cryptocurrencies.
				Per a client request, I created a script that can place market sell orders and auto withdraw orders on the cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia.
				I helped another Discord server deploy a bot that pulls data from coinmarketcap.com's API in real time to track cryptocurrency metrics.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Currently, I'm working on a cryptocurrency trend tracker, to scrape and parse raw data from social media channels
				to run some analysis over time to find useful correlations and patterns to make auto-trading decisions.
