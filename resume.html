            <h2>Auction Website (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL)</h2>
            <p>
                Class project aimed to simulate a real client website design workflow,
                with simulated client interaction and feedback in between sprints.
                Front end was built using HTML and CSS.
                Back end was built using MySQL and PHP.
                Website was hosted on a university Apache server.
                Users were able to create accounts, bid on auctions, create auctions,
                and a payment model was mocked up in place.
                Inputs were santized, HTTPS was enforced,
                and security measures were implemented against XSS vulnerabilities, SQL injections,
                and malicious binary image data execution.
                Website is currently deployed on Heroku.
            </p>

                React Auction Web Application

            </h2>
            <p>
                Refactored my LAMP stack auction website using a more modern tech stack
                and designed to operate as a single page application.
                React was the framework used for the front end,
                Axios used in middleware to make HTTP requests from the front-end client
                to the front-facing API created using Postgrest to allow user interaction with the back-end database.
                Node/Express/PostgresQL were used to build the back end. Website is currently deployed on Heroku.

            <h2>Cryptocurrency Auto-Sell / Auto-Withdraw Script (Python)</h2>
            <p>
                Utilizes an open-source cryptocurrency python wrapper.
                The script periodically checks a userâ€™s balance on the cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia
                and creates BTC market rate sell orders on the marketplace
                and withdraws to wallet based on user-configured thresholds.
            </p>
            <h2>Cryptocurrency Trend Tracker (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Python)</h2>
            <p>
                Series of scripts that monitors cryptocurrency mentions on Reddit
                and Twitter based on continually refined heuristics, as well as the average
                exchange price of hand-curated cryptocurrencies from coinmarketcap.com.
                The front end will continually monitor the script data and after a length of time
                we will run a general time series analysis and use the data to build an
                autonomous cryptocurrency trading model.

            <h2>Discord Bot (Python)</h2>
            <p>
                Created a python-based bot that interacts with users in a discord group.
                Bot has a set of commands and a flat file database to draw quotes from and add quotes to.
                Additionally, the bot also has other commands that users can call.
                The bot is hosted on my RaspberryPi and runs in the background 24/7 with nohup.
